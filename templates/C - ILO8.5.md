# ILO 8.5 Computer Vision

The student demonstrates mastery in programming skills to acquire, pre-process, process, and manage digital images, alongside applying modeling techniques, including traditional computer vision and deep learning methods, to create value across various domains. Furthermore, the student is proficient in developing proof-of-concept solutions through an iterative cycle with explicit stakeholder involvement and can implement applications within existing architectures.

|pre-requisites|A: 10 points|B: 20 points|

|The student exhibits professional behaviour during DataLab sessions. Student submitted successfully labeled images as part of the project. Student presented their findings during the final block presentation.|The student demonstrates the ability to design and implement deep learning models for object detection or image segmentation using industry-standard deep learning frameworks, ensuring compatibility between neural network architecture and components in line with client requirements.|The student demonstrates the ability to design and implement end-to-end computer vision pipelines that merge data processing, traditional computer vision, and deep learning; iterate this pipeline towards an optimal solution using techniques such as transfer learning, hyperparameter tuning, data collections. The student demonstrates the ability to extract, process, and analyze quantitative information from images using appropriate algorithms and methods that are in or outside of the computer vision domain. Meanwhile, the student tracks these iterations with industry-standard experiment tracking tools. The student demonstrates the ability to deliver an optimal computer vision solution, in line with client requirements.|

## Notes on this ILO

This ILO is a must pass ILO.

This ILO is linked to DataLab Tasks 5 and 8. The labeling assignment (Task 1) and the presentation (Task 14) are pre-requisites.

## Criterion A

This criterion is linked to DataLab Task 5. Justify why you meet this criterion.

For example: “I trained a U-Net model for root segmentation, achieving an F1 score of 0.8021 on the validation set. I also developed inference code capable of processing raw images from Hades and generating the corresponding predicted masks.”

## Criterion B

This criterion is linked to DataLab Task 8. Justify why you meet this criterion.

For example: “I developed a computer vision pipeline capable of processing any number of raw images from Hades and generating the primary root lengths for each plant. My predictions were submitted to the Kaggle competition, achieving a 13% sMAPE on the private leaderboard and securing 10th place in the competition.”
