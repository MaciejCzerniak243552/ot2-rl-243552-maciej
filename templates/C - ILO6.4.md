# ILO 6.4 Image Data

The student demonstrates the ability to collect, label, and process image data.

|pre-requisites|A: 5 points|B: 3 points|C: 2 points|
|--|--|--|--|
|The student exhibits professional behaviour during DataLab sessions.|The student accurately annotates images for object detection or image segmentation and provides constructive feedback on the quality of peer annotations, in line with client requirements.|The student demonstrates the ability to load, display, and save images, convert between color spaces, and perform basic image manipulations such as resizing, cropping, or rotating. The student demonstrates the ability to perform intermediate image manipulations such as annotating with shapes, overlaying text, and applying masks to isolate regions, in line with client requirements, using industry standard tools.|The student demonstrates the ability to filter images for noise reduction and image enhancement; apply thresholding, edge, and contour detection. The student demonstrates the ability to execute morphological operations on images; combine various traditional computer vision methods effectively to build image segmentation and object detection pipelines without machine learning, in line with client requirements, using industry standard tools.|

## Notes on this ILO

This ILO is linked to DataLab Tasks 1, 2, 3.

## Criterion A

This criterion is linked to DataLab Task 1. Briefly describe your assignment results.

For example: “I delivered masks with minor quality issues (2/3) and provided an accurate peer review (2/2)”.

### Evidence

No evidence link is required.

## Criterion B

This criterion is linked to DataLab Task 2. Justify why you meet this criterion.
