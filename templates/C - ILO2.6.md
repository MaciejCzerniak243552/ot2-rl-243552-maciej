# ILO 2.6 Critical Thinking

The student is able to apply critical thinking skills during the block on the project and the learning experience.

|pre-requisites|A: 10 Points|
|--|--|
|The student submits a complete learning log, work log, and self-assessment rubric. The student exhibits professional behaviour during DataLab sessions.|The student demonstrates the ability to critically evaluate their approach to solving computer vision tasks by reflecting on daily progress through work log entries and weekly progress through the learning log. This includes error analysis, identifying challenges, identifying edge cases, justifying decisions, listing assumptions and planning next steps to iteratively improve the project. The student consistently applies these reflections to optimize workflow and enhance problem-solving strategies, with the iterative improvement clearly identifiable in the worklog and learning log section B. The student can communicate three crucial iterations to the stakeholders.|

## Notes on this ILO

This ILO is linked to worklog, learning log, and DataLab Task 14.

- Worklog: In your worklog, ensure that you log items where the “Most suited ILO” is ILO 2.6, with a minimum of two entries per week.
- Learning Log: In Section B (Reflection) of your learning log, address the question linked to ILO 2.6 each week based on your worklog entries of the week.
- Presentation: During your presentation, highlight at least three significant iterations selected from your worklog or learning log.

## Criterion A

Justify why you meet this criterion.

For example: “I logged at least five work items each week, with a total of 50 work items for the entire project, as documented in my worklog. Each week, I summarized these items in Section B of my learning log. In my presentation (slides 8, 9, and 10), I showcased three key iterations that were most impactful.”
