# Reflecting on Past Block 

### What feedback did you get from your mentor, and what grade did you obtain?

**Grade**: 7.2

**Feedback**: "Maciej, congrats on finishing your first (and probably last?) NLP project! Even though you struggled with enthusiasm towards the project at hand, you still delivered a good outcome. I hope that you can discover your passion in the next blocks!"


### What are your key take-aways from the past block and the feedback you received?

I find NLP as difficult section of AI. Moreover, it was hard for me to agreed with some assigned labels. It seems like NLP models which I used are so sensitive to separate words. Sometimes they are not taking in consideration the sentences. Am I satisfied? Definitely no. I lost 10 point because I missed the deadline for ILO 2.7. I plan to retake this ILO

### What will you do the same this block, and what areas can you improve on?

I will keep up with...

I will improve... 


### What SMARTER goal(s) can you create out of these reflections?
