## Week 2

**What went well this week?**
------------------------------
This week went well in terms of technical progress. I completed the remaining Week 1 notebook and made solid progress with the Week 2 notebooks. I also advanced significantly in Task 1 (peer review annotation) and Task 2 (Petri dish detection), where I managed to solve the core logic challenge using OpenCV’s connectedComponentsWithStats. Task 3 (plant instance segmentation) was completed successfully, and I am now at the stage of cleaning and refining the code.
Additionally, the feedback session was very helpful and gave me clearer guidance on how to demonstrate critical thinking in my reflections.

**What did you struggle with this week?**
------------------------------
My main struggle was maintaining focus when switching between different types of tasks, such as notebooks, programming, and training sessions. On one day, I noticed that my productivity dropped significantly due to mental fatigue, which made working on the Week 2 notebooks ineffective. I also initially struggled with understanding the logic behind Task 2, although this improved once I revisited the notebooks and documentation.

**How did your efforts in applying iterative critical thinking this week
contribute to improving your approach to the project? (ILO 2.6)**
------------------------------
I applied iterative critical thinking by actively reflecting on both technical and workflow-related challenges. When I struggled with Task 2, I revisited relevant notebooks and external documentation rather than continuing blindly, which led me to a more robust solution.
Additionally, when I noticed a drop in focus while working on the Week 2 notebooks, I consciously stopped, evaluated the cause, and adjusted my approach instead of forcing progress. This reflection helped me recognize that frequent task switching negatively affects my concentration, allowing me to plan more focused work sessions going forward.

**Based on this, what action points can you create for next week?**
------------------------------
1. Continue applying mentor feedback by writing more explicit and structured reflections.
2. Finalize and clean code for completed tasks to improve readability and quality.
3. Start notebooks earlier in the week to avoid delays and mental overload.
4. Regularly assess concentration levels and adjust the workflow when productivity drops.
