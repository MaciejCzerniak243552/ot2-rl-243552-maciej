# 2B - Computer Vision & Robotics

In this block, you will learn about the fundamentals of Computer Vision, Robotics and Reinforcement Learning.

This learning log consists of the following sections:
- A - Reflection on past block
- B - Weekly logs (numbered by week)
- C - Evidencing Learning Outcomes
- D - Reflection on the current block

## Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes for this block are the following:

1.6 Presentation: The student demonstrates the ability to convert project findings into a coherent and structured presentation. The student is able to communicate the project findings in a professional manner tailored to the audience. 

2.6 Critical Thinking: The student is able to apply critical thinking skills during the block on the project and the learning experience.

5.1 Domain Knowledge: The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the project domain by accurately describing the client and outlining the problem using appropriate domain-specific terminology.

6.4 Image Data: The student demonstrates the ability to collect, label, and process image data.

8.5 Computer Vision: The student demonstrates mastery in programming skills to acquire, pre-process, process, and manage digital images, alongside applying modeling techniques, including traditional computer vision and deep learning methods, to create value across various domains. Furthermore, the student is proficient in developing proof-of-concept solutions through an iterative cycle with explicit stakeholder involvement and can implement applications within existing architectures.

8.6 Robotic Control and Reinforcement Learning: The student is able to design, implement, and evaluate control algorithms and reinforcement learning algorithms, integrating computer vision techniques for perception, to effectively address business objectives.

## Evidencing ILO's

Per ILO, there is a page where you can link the evidence for that ILO. For some components, you will be graded via Brightspace. Adding evidence is not necessary. The ILO page will indicate what evidence is needed for that subcomponent.

## Using Markdown

The pages are written in markdown. Markdown files end with the `.md` extension. If you are unfamiliar with the formatting of Markdown, you can use this [cheat sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/markdown-cheat-sheet-23?utm_cid=19589720821&utm_aid=152984012374&utm_campaign=230119_1-ps-other~dsa~tofu_2-b2c_3-emea_4-prc_5-na_6-na_7-le_8-pdsh-go_9-nb-e_10-na_11-na&utm_loc=9220061-&utm_mtd=-c&utm_kw=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_content=ps-other~emea-en~dsa~tofu~cheat-sheet-data-science&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=19589720821&gbraid=0AAAAADQ9WsHi-NrpYc5jD1jwOcO6JW2ib&gclid=CjwKCAjwk7DFBhBAEiwAeYbJsYHbRBNypAPMaiJ2jcQ_vQvAThgBRb1nCvWeIwjOjRd4_hLMqCDboxoCoeAQAvD_BwE) to help you get started!

Some tips:

### Links

This code:

```markdown
[Example Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)
```

will look like this:

[Example Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)

### Tables

This code:

```markdown
|  |A |B |
|--|--|--|
|x |y |z |
```

will look like this:

|  |A |B |
|--|--|--|
|x |y |z |

for large tables you can use the website [TablesGenerator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) and copy/paste the output.

### Images

This code:

```markdown
![](../GH_screenshot.png)
```

will look like this

![](../GH_screenshot.png)

you can use HTML for more control. This code:

```html
<figure style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="../GH_screenshot.png" style="width:50%">
  <figcaption>Short, meaningful caption.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

will look like this:

<figure style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="../GH_screenshot.png" style="width:50%">
  <figcaption>Short, meaningful caption.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Using Markdown in VSCode

You can preview `.md` files easily with VSCode. Open the file you would like to preview and use:

- Shortcut
    - macOS → `⌘ + Shift + V`
    - Windows/Linux → `Ctrl + Shift + V`

- Icon method:
    - Click the preview icon (a small split-screen) in the top-right corner of the editor.
