## Week 1

**What went well this week?**
------------------------------
This week went very well overall. I felt highly motivated at the start of the new block, especially due to my strong interest in computer vision. The kick-off and first stand-up with my mentor helped set clear expectations, which I found motivating. I made good progress on image annotation and started the Week 1 notebooks, while also keeping up with the required reading. Starting the book before the block officially began proved to be a good decision, as it reduced pressure during the week and allowed me to better absorb the material.

**What did you struggle with this week?**
------------------------------
The main challenge was image annotation. Distinguishing between the four classes (root, seed, shoot, and background) was more difficult than expected, especially when boundaries were unclear due to lighting or overlapping structures. Reading also took longer than anticipated because of my dyslexia, and I found it difficult to accurately track the time spent on reading. Balancing block tasks with external responsibilities, such as the workshop and lab work, was also demanding.

**How did your efforts in applying iterative critical thinking this week
contribute to improving your approach to the project? (ILO 2.6)**
------------------------------
I applied iterative critical thinking by continuously reassessing my assumptions during image annotation. Instead of relying solely on initial visual cues like color or shape, I began questioning my labels and reflecting on uncertainty. When unsure, I noted the need to consult with a mentor rather than proceeding blindly. I also reflected on my learning process early in the week and adjusted my strategy by starting reading earlier, which improved my overall workflow and reduced cognitive overload.

**Based on this, what action points can you create for next week?**
------------------------------
1. Continue image annotation with greater caution and validate uncertain cases with a mentor.
2. Allocate extra time for reading and theoretical material to account for longer processing time.
3. Progress further with the Week 1 notebooks and begin Week 2 materials early if possible.
4. Keep reflecting on task difficulty and adjust my workflow iteratively to stay efficient and motivated.
5. Maintain early preparation as a strategy for tasks requiring sustained focus.
