## Week 5

**What went well this week?**
------------------------------
This week went well in terms of consolidation and decision-making. I reached a stable and competitive solution for Task 7 (RSA extraction) and, after several attempts, concluded that further optimization would not yield meaningful improvements without major changes. Shifting focus to Task 8 and building the final end-to-end pipeline was a productive decision, as it helped me see how all components of the project interact.

I also made progress across multiple domains: I continued experimenting with Task 5 by testing alternative loss functions and data augmentation, completed Task 9 by exploring the Opentrons OT-2 work envelope, and began working on Task 10 (PID controller). Attending sessions on end-of-block challenges, exchange opportunities, and robotics helped me reflect on my broader learning goals and future directions.

**What did you struggle with this week?**
------------------------------
It was difficult to stop iterating on Task 7 despite investing significant effort, but further changes did not lead to improvements. In Task 5, experimenting with Dice loss and combined loss functions did not improve results, which was somewhat frustrating.

I also struggled with the robotics component, particularly the lack of hands-on self-study materials. While I understand the theory behind reinforcement learning and PID control, I found it harder to internalize these concepts without practical coding examples. This uncertainty became clear when starting Task 10, where I was unsure whether my implementation approach was correct.

**How did your efforts in applying iterative critical thinking this week
contribute to improving your approach to the project? (ILO 2.6)**
------------------------------
I applied iterative critical thinking by continuously evaluating whether my efforts were producing meaningful outcomes. When repeated attempts to improve Task 7 yielded no measurable gains, I reassessed my priorities and redirected my focus toward building the final pipeline, which provided greater overall value.

Similarly, in Task 5, I treated unsuccessful experiments with new loss functions not as failures but as informative results that guided my next steps toward data augmentation rather than architectural tuning. In robotics tasks, I recognized the limits of my confidence and chose to pause and seek mentor feedback rather than continuing with an uncertain approach. These decisions reflect a more strategic and reflective way of managing complexity and uncertainty.

**Based on this, what action points can you create for next week?**
------------------------------
1. Evaluate the impact of data augmentation on Task 5 before attempting further model changes.
2. Consult the mentor about the PID controller implementation to validate the approach.
3. Focus on robotics learning through hands-on coding rather than theory alone where possible.
4. Prioritize tasks based on impact and feasibility rather than continued fine-tuning.
