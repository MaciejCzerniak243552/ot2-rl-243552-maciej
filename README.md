## Github Repo & Learning Log via Wiki 
This personal github repository contains a structure for the Github Wiki learning log and the usual github code repository features. The Github Wiki pages are set up and connected to Github actions. 

Do not change anything about the following folders and their file names:
- ``.github``
- ``wiki-src``


### Setting up your Wiki 
In the ``wiki-src`` folder, you will find all the files that make up your learning log. These are divided into the sections as you know them. Section A needs to be filled in at the start of the new block. Section B, you need to update every week. There is a separate page for feedback, where you can collect all feedback that you recieve during the block. There is also a separate page dedicated to the reading questions that you need to answer throughout the block. Section C contains pages for every ILO. Section D is a reflection on the block that you need to fill in week 8. In weeks 3, 5 and 7 we will have feedback sessions. In those weeks, there is a question in the weekly log that you can fill in beforehand to prepare well for your feedback session. 

To 'launch' your wiki learning log, you need to go to the wiki tab in Github in the browser.

 There, you will find a button to start your wiki pages. This will trigger an action that loads all the files from the code repository into the Github wiki. 

Essentially, the Github code repository and the Github wiki are two different repositories. Through github actions, we set up workflows for you so that all files are in one repository available for you. This is less bookkeeping and switching between repositories.
If you commit and push files, an action is triggered and the wiki files are synchronized with the wiki repo. Therefore, it is important that you **do not** change the folder or file names that were already present when you created this repository. You are free to add folders and files to your liking for the evidencing etc. of your work. 

This wiki set-up is a pilot that we will run this year. If you have any tips or remarks, please submit them at the end-of-block survey and we will try to improve it over the subsequent blocks. If you have any issues in the mean time that prohibit you from doing your work in a proper way, please come speak to Myrthe Buckens. 

We run this pilot to hopefully make your life easier. It is less switching between programs if you can update your progress and ILO evidencing in the same repository as you are doing your work. If you update regularly, your mentor can also keep an eye on your progress and steer you in the right direction where possible. 

### Using Markdown 
The wiki pages are written in markdown. Markdown files end with the .md extension. If you are unfamiliar with the formatting of Markdown, you can use this [cheat sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/markdown-cheat-sheet-23?utm_cid=19589720821&utm_aid=152984012374&utm_campaign=230119_1-ps-other~dsa~tofu_2-b2c_3-emea_4-prc_5-na_6-na_7-le_8-pdsh-go_9-nb-e_10-na_11-na&utm_loc=9220061-&utm_mtd=-c&utm_kw=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_content=ps-other~emea-en~dsa~tofu~cheat-sheet-data-science&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=19589720821&gbraid=0AAAAADQ9WsHi-NrpYc5jD1jwOcO6JW2ib&gclid=CjwKCAjwk7DFBhBAEiwAeYbJsYHbRBNypAPMaiJ2jcQ_vQvAThgBRb1nCvWeIwjOjRd4_hLMqCDboxoCoeAQAvD_BwE) to help you get started! 

Some tips: 

1. If you want to provide evidence to a file that is in your Github Code Repository, you can do so by providing a name in square brackets link [model iterations]() directly followed by the link in between brackets (). 
2. If you want to format a table, you can easily use the website [TablesGenerator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) and copy/paste the output. 
3. If you want to preview a markdown file in your VSCode editor, press CRTL+SHIFT+V.
